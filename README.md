# SFML-Pong

Pong Clone written in C++ with SFML.

## Why

I worked on this project for two main reasons: 
  1.) Refresher in C++ 
  2.) I needed to prove to my self that I can program, even if it is not the most elegantly written.


## What Did I Learn

1. How a game loop works
2. How Vector2f works
3. How to detect rectangular box collision in SFML

## Things That Need To Be Fixed/To Be Finished

1. Updating the Score
2. Fixing how the ball bounces of the paddles
